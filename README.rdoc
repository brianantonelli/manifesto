= manifesto

Manifesto dynamically generates an {HTML5 cache manifest}[http://developer.apple.com/safari/library/documentation/iphone/conceptual/safarijsdatabaseguide/OfflineApplicationCache/OfflineApplicationCache.html] for offline application caching. It returns a list of files within the specified directory and sub-directories.
By default it also includes a computed hash of the files' contents, so that if a file is changed a different hash is produced, causing the cache to be automatically invalidated.

== Requirements

* Ruby >= 1.8.6 (not tested with previous versions)

== Installation

This library is intended to be installed as a Gem.

  $ gem install manifesto

You might need administrator privileges on your system to install it.

== Usage

  # Basic usage, list all non-hidden files in ./public and include a computed hash of their contents
  Manifesto.cache
  
  # Specify a directory
  Manifesto.cache :directory => './mobile'
  
  # Specify a directory and don't compute the hash
  Manifesto.cache :directory => './mobile', :compute_hash => false
  
== Sample Output

  CACHE MANIFEST
  # Generated by manifesto (http://github.com/johntopley/manifesto)
  # Hash: 7013a3b8292ceeeb6336849bee1d1365
  /apple-touch-icon.png
  /apple-touch-startup.png
  /index.html
  /mobile/mobile.css
  /mobile/mobile.js

== Sinatra Example

   require 'manifesto.rb'
   
   get '/manifest' do
     headers 'Content-Type' => 'text/cache-manifest' # Must be served with this MIME type
     Manifesto.cache
   end

== Note on Patches/Pull Requests
 
* Fork the project
* Make your feature addition or bug fix
* Add tests for it. This is important so I don't break it in a
  future version unintentionally
* Commit, do not mess with rakefile, version, or history
  (if you want to have your own version, that is fine but bump version in a commit by itself I can ignore when I pull)
* Send me a pull request. Bonus points for topic branches
